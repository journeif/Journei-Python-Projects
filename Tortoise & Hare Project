#Tortoise & Hare Project
#Recreate the classic race of the tortoise and the hare
'''
Variables
- Tortoise
- Hare
- Counter, which will count the time elapsed
import random function to generate random numbers
import time to add a clock that tells the time that has passed
create a while loop that states while tortoise & hare are less than <70 
ex: while tortoise <70 and hare <70: #while loop states if tortoise and hare are both less than 70 continue the program 
Sleep function allows to lag 1 second
depending on i will determine the move

Ex: if i <= 5: #if random number is less than or equal to return 3
    print("The tortoise is flying!!!! Fast plod")
    return 3 #move 3 squares to the right

Provide commentary on each turn
ex:elif i == 6 or i ==7: #if random number is equal to 6 or 7 
    return -6
    print("The tortoise slipped! OMG") #commentary
Display time elapsed and position each turn 
ex: print("postion of the hare: ", hare) #the position of the hare 
    print("position of the tortoise: ",tortoise) #the position of tortoise
    print("Time elapsed: ",counter,"\n")
If both passed 70 its a tie
Check if either has passed 70 & display the winner
ex: elif tortoise >= 70 and hare >= 70: #if tortoise and hare are both greater than or equal 70 than ots a tie
      print("AW, ITS A TIE")
    if tortoise >= 70: #if the tortoise greater than or equal to 70 
      print("THE TORTOISE IS THE WINNER!!!") #the tortoise is the winner
    elif hare >= 70: #if hare is greater than or equal to 70 
      print("THE HARE IS THE WINNER!!!") #the hare is the winner
If its negative return the animal back to 1
ex: hare = 1 & tortoise = 1
